After more than a year's development, the new ZJU Mirror site is finally here. It's developed and maintained by [ZJUSCT](https://www.zjusct.io/) with hardware support from [Information Technology Center of Zhejiang University](https://zuits.zju.edu.cn/). Issues related to the new mirror site including mirror request and bugs can be reported in [our dedicated issue repo](https://github.com/ZJUSCT/mirror-issues). Hope you enjoy using it!
